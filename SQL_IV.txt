---- SQL Subqueries and Temporary Tables
 We want to find the average number of events for each day for each channel. The first table will provide us the number of events for each day and channel, and then we will need to average these values together using a second query.

-- Query 1 (full)
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('day', day) AS day_event, 
    channel, 
    AVG(event_count) AS event_avg
FROM
  (SELECT 
       DATE_TRUNC('day', occurred_at) AS day, 
       channel, COUNT(*) AS event_count
   FROM web_events
   GROUP BY day, channel) AS event_table
GROUP BY day_event, channel
ORDER BY event_avg DESC;

-- Query 1 (question 1)
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('day', occurred_at) AS day, 
    channel, COUNT(*) AS event_count
FROM web_events
GROUP BY day, channel
ORDER BY event_count DESC;

-- Query 2
SELECT 
    channel, 
    AVG(event_count) AS event_avg
FROM
  (SELECT 
        DATE_TRUNC('day', occurred_at) AS day, 
        channel, COUNT(*) AS event_count
   FROM web_events
   GROUP BY day, channel) AS event_table
GROUP BY channel
ORDER BY event_avg DESC;
